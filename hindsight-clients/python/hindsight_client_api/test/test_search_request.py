    Agent Memory API

     A temporal-semantic memory system for AI agents that stores, retrieves, and reasons over memories.  ## Features  * **Batch Memory Storage**: Store multiple memories efficiently with automatic fact extraction * **Semantic Search**: Find relevant memories using natural language queries * **Fact Type Filtering**: Search across world facts, agent actions, and opinions separately * **Think Endpoint**: Generate contextual answers based on agent identity and memories * **Graph Visualization**: Interactive memory graph visualization * **Document Tracking**: Track and manage memory documents with upsert support  ## Architecture  The system uses: - **Temporal Links**: Connect memories that are close in time - **Semantic Links**: Connect semantically similar memories - **Entity Links**: Connect memories that mention the same entities - **Spreading Activation**: Intelligent traversal for memory retrieval
